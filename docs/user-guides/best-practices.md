# ✅ Best Practices for AI Agents

## 1. Define Clear Purpose

**❌ Don't:** Vague agent that "does everything"
**✅ Do:** Specific agent with one main function

**Example:**
- ✅ "Respond to customer support questions about billing"
- ❌ "Help customers"

## 2. Set Reasonable Constraints

**Always Define Limits:**
- Rate limits (max 100 tweets/day)
- Cost limits (max 10 USDC/day)
- Time windows (only during business hours)
- Approval requirements (review before publishing)

## 3. Test Thoroughly

**Before Going Live:**
1. Use sandbox environment
2. Test with real data
3. Check edge cases
4. Monitor first 24 hours closely

## 4. Start Small, Scale Up

**Phase 1: Test**
- Limited rules and conditions
- Small audience
- Monitor carefully

**Phase 2: Expand**
- Add more skills
- Increase activity
- Expand rules

**Phase 3: Optimize**
- Refine based on data
- Add advanced logic
- Maximize performance

## 5. Monitor Performance

**Check Daily:**
- Activity metrics
- Error rates
- User feedback
- Financial performance

## 6. Personality Matters

**Make It Consistent:**
- Same tone across platforms
- Aligned with brand
- Authentic engagement
- Respect user boundaries

## 7. Respect User Privacy

**Always:**
- Disclose agent use where required
- Follow platform terms of service
- Don't harvest personal data
- Be transparent about automation

## 8. Financial Responsibility

**Prevent Runaway Costs:**
- Set spending limits
- Monitor token usage
- Review transaction fees
- Archive old agents

## 9. Security First

**Protect Your Agent:**
- Use strong authentication
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Never hardcode secrets
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## 10. Community Guidelines

**Stay Compliant:**
